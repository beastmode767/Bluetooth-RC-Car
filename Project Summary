# Bluetooth-RC-Car
Remote Controlled Car powered by an Arduino via Bluetooth from an Android App.
This projects utilizes bluetooth communication, DC motor control, and C++ coding. 

Features of this project:
-Bluetooth connection using an "HC-05".
-"Arduino UNO" microcontroller for command processing.
-Four "DC motors" controlled using one "L298N Motor Driver".
-Android APP connected to "HC-05" to control the RC Car.
-Arduino APP for coding using C++.
-Utilizing lithium batteries to power the RC Car without connecting it to a laptop.
-Wood Cutting and drilling to make build the frame of Car.

Future Improvements:
-I will add a sensor on the front of the car. Make it automated to move and turn when an obstacle is in front of it.
-Attach the components more proffesionally to the frame, rathen than taping.
